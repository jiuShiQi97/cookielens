## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The extension is built with vanilla JavaScript and follows Chrome extension best practices:

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration
- `background/service-worker.js`: Manages DNR rules and settings
- `content/content.js`: Detects banners and shows modal
- `content/explain.js`: Analyzes page and generates explanations
- `content/dnr-rules.json`: Blocking rules for non-essential cookies
- `options/`: Settings page for user preferences

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Modal not appearing**: Try refreshing the page and clicking the banner again
- **Blocking not working**: Check that the extension has necessary permissions
- **Policy extraction fails**: Check console for error messages
- **Site breaks**: Use "Site's original options" to proceed normally
